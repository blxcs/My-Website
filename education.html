 <td colspan="2" align="justify">My journey at SMK Toh Muda Abdul Aziz from Form 4 to Form 6 (2019-2023) was transformative. Starting in 2019, I faced new academic challenges. Form 5 brought intense SPM preparations, fostering strong friendships through study sessions. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 shifted us to online learning, but we adapted and stayed connected. By Form 6, I embraced leadership roles and explored career paths. Graduation in 2023 was bittersweet, marking the end of an era filled with growth, learning, and unforgettable memories. I'm deeply grateful for the support and experiences I gained.</td>
